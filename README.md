In today’s world, effective and efficient education is more important than ever. However, students and teachers often face fragmented learning experiences across multiple tools. That’s where EduNova comes in.
EduNova is an all-in-one, intuitive educational platform designed to bridge the gap between learning, teaching and examining. Tailored to meet the needs of modern classrooms and individual students, it offers seamless collaboration, content management, and real-time communication — all in one place, like never before.
For teachers, it simplifies lesson planning, grading, examining and communication with students and parents. They can effortlessly share resources, track progress, and even create personalized learning experiences with the help of our integrated AI.
For students, it’s an engaging and centralized hub where they can access lessons, collaborate with peers, submit and create assignments, receive instant feedback, and learn with the help of ai, through extra explanations, flashcards and quizzes — all in an easy-to-navigate interface.
A major problem in today's society is the fragmentation of educational platforms. Some schools pay up to multiple thousand dollars a year for multiple services. Hence, we've decided to save the world some money, and developed software, which is truly all in one.
- You can take notes with it,
- you can read your textbook with it,
- you can get quizzed on your knowledge by ai,
- you can make assignments in it,
- you can even write exams in it

This means a complete digitalization of education, and would greatly reduce the amount of paper used in education, saving millions of trees.
But words aren't enough to truly show you what we have done. (we demonstrate the demo)

Pricing and profitability:
We have decided to go with the subscription model, since it helps pay maintaining costs, and is generally more profitable than a one time transaction.
Our service would cost approximately 400$/month for an entire school, which is a price that may not necessarily compete with services such as Google classrooms, but we make eclecticism our core value, so Google is not a perfect competitor. Rather, we compete with all other educational platforms, as we have features that make all other educational platforms redundant. And once you start comparing the prices of EduNova against the others, there is a clear difference in price. EduNova is cheaper. And it archives this without falling back on shady practices like selling your data, not to call out any names.
As for profitability, we are in the green, literally and figuratively. Since maintenance costs, assuming there are 500 students in a school, for the service round up to about 250$, we make roughly 150$/month for each school. And with the price, the project is bound to be picked up by many schools trying to save money, meaning our scalability is huge. It is also important to note that the price could differ from place to place, as the purchasing power of schools is vastly different from country to country. The price we have offered seems reasonable for the west-eastern eu market and includes the server prices from that geographical location.

Teamwork
Our team has decided it would be best if we could work in person, since it will greatly improve productivity. That is the reason why we didn't use the discord channel provided by you. We also used a private group to discuss the project, with multiple hundreds of messages, and multiple voice calls late into the evening/night. (show scrolling over the discord group)
We have also used services like github and google drive to share ideas and progress.
